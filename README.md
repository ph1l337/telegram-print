#Telegram Print
This is a Proof of Concept of a python script that allows you to run a telegram bot, that prints out files that are being send to him.

Currently it's implemented to only work with PDFs.

**Caution:** currently this script doesn't check the sender of the file - so basically anyone can print using the bot. 

This repository uses the great [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) wrapper for the Telegram API.
